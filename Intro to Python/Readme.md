## Intro to Python

This is the space where I solve the exercises of first year's Intro to Python. 
The exercises are from the textbook "Intro to Python" by  Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel which we use for the purpose of this university class.

Print-ISBN: 978-1-292-36490-2
E-ISBN: 978-1-292-36493-3

The solutions are my personal effort to get better in Python!
